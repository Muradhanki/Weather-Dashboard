## About The Project


https://muradhanki.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

In this assignment, I have created a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I have used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.

The app contains the following requirements:

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
